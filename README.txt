# QDS Battery Whisperer Demo

A lightweight, phone-friendly dashboard for exploring battery stress, cycles, and ageing.
Built as a static HTML/JS lab that can run from any simple web server or directly in a browser.

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser  
   – or serve the folder with a simple command like `python -m http.server`.

The app uses Chart.js from a CDN for charts; once your browser has loaded it, it usually stays cached.

## What it’s for

This demo is part of the Quantum Design Systems “Battery Whisperer” concept:  
helping labs and engineers understand how usage patterns, depth-of-discharge and temperature
affect battery health, in a clear visual way.
